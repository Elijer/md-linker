# Description

To use this extension, select the text you want from a webpage on chrome, press SHIFT + COMMAND + PERIOD (".") simultaneously, and you should have a markdown link in your clipboard ready to be pasted.

This extension provides a hotkey for formatting the selected text into a markdown hyperlink that is linked to the current page. If you are not familiar with markdown, its syntax universally allows for links to be included with the format `[text](url)`. This format is pretty popular in other note-taking context as well, such as notion and slack. If you are tired all the switching and copying required for this type of documentation/research/note-taking process, then this tool will help you copy markdown links in half the time and with a bit less typing.
